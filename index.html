    <p>Hi, my name is ostap [o s t a p] kryvytskyy [k r y v y t s k y y].</p>

    <p>I am reachable at ostap_kryvytskyy@icloud.com. Skype: zenvsok</p>

    <p>I am software engineer, I create and fix software.</p>
    <p>I am 33 y.o. native Ukrainian from Western Ukraine, Lviv region and city.</p>
    <p>The most of my achievement in life so far was implementation of nastygal.com website for 2 years long - since 2015.</p>

    <p>I appreciate all people, which helped me during this process. I am graceful for the rest of my life for that to you. I also appreciate anyone searching help from me with any question they may have. </p>
    <p>Primarily I started from BASIC and C at school and that ability proliferated into various programming languages and techniques. I also appreciate the other people work beforehead that allowed me to proceed further. Mainly I love both BASIC and C, but I also programmed PASCAL, DELPHI and VISUAL TURBO/PASCAL. Than my ability grow into loving web development and perl. I tried HTML/CSS and developed a landing page for another country supermarket using tables. I also migrated that page into divs. It looks like I could thrive with that, but no. I must developed much more stronger background, which was fulfilled with FoxPro and finally Java. I tried to move into all sorts of programming with Java and indeed that happened with help of Google GWT team. Thanks, guys for that. GWT allowed Java to be main development language for the front-end JavaScript, which went upwards later. Now Java is far beyond the interesting point mainly because it lack of safeness for me and rise of decompilers. I switched to the far more interesting native world - .NET, ASP.NET, C, C++, Objective-C, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and all the devices, which represent it.</p>

    <p>I am reachable at ostap_kryvytskyy@icloud.com.</p>

    <p>Best wishes!</p>
