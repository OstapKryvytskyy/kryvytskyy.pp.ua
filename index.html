    <p>Hi, my name is ostap [o s t a p] kryvytskyy [k r y v y t s k y y].</p>

    <p>I am reachable at ostap_kryvytskyy@icloud.com. Skype: zenvsok</p>

    <p>I am software engineer, I create and fix software.</p>
    <p>I am 33 y.o. native Ukrainian from Western Ukraine, Lviv region and city.</p>
    <p>The most of my achievement in life so far was implementation of nastygal.com website for 3 years long - since 2015. I also have my work implemented in zert.se technologies and AccuRev (https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/accurev/overview).</p>

    <p>I appreciate all people, which helped me during this process. I also appreciate anyone searching help from me with any question they may have.</p>
    
    <p>I appreciate the other people work beforehead that allowed me to proceed further. Primarily I started from BASIC and C at school and that ability proliferated into various programming languages and techniques. Mainly I love both BASIC and C and I also programmed PASCAL and DELPHI. Than I got into fascinating world of web and web development. I worked with HTML/CSS on young Lviv Spline Software company and developed a landing page for Netherland's supermarket using tables. I also migrated that page into divs. It looks like I could thrive with that, but no. I must have developed much more stronger background, which was fulfilled with FoxPro, Visual BASIC, java. 
I became certified proffessional. It is interesting native world - C, C++, C# on.NET, ASP.NET, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Objective-C and all the devices, which represent it.</p>

    <p>I am reachable at Skype: zenvsok and email: ostap_kryvytskyy@icloud.com.</p>

    <p>Mit freundlichen Grüßen!</p>
    <p>Danke and Thank you!</p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
